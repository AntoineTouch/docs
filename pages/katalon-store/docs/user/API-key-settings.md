## API Keys usage

In the command-line execution, API Keys play a role as a user's credentials to download and install plugins in Katalon Studio before proceeding to execution.

Without API keys applied, Katalon Studio executes a test as you haven't installed any plugins yet. Therefore, the API Key is a must-have for using a plugin during the execution in the console mode.

## Create a new key

To create an API Key, do as follows:

1. Navigate to Katalon Store **[My Account](https://store.katalon.com/account)** > select the **Security** tab.
1. Click on the **Generate Key** button > Input a **Title** for your API Key > Click on the **Add key** button.

You have created a new API Key successfully.

## Remove an existing key

1. Log into [Katalon Store](https://store.katalon.com/) > **[My Account](https://store.katalon.com/account)** > select the **Security** tab
2. Click on the **Remove** button of the key you want to remove > Click **OK** to confirm your removal.

> Note: You cannot undo this action. Once a key is removed, it cannot be used anymore.
