12. The Windows test is executed with those recorded steps accordingly.

>**Notes**:
>
> 1. While any action is being performed on a test object, there should be no other actions taken on the application. One action at a time.
> 2. Remember not to lock your screen while spying, recording or executing a test on a desktop application.
> 3. You're recommended not to run multiple applications simultaneously.
