First export your Postman collection to JSON. See the instruction [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#exporting-and-importing-postman-data). 

Then in Katalon Studio, create a new API/Web Service project (currently the only type of project supporting this Postman collection import feature), and click on Postman icon on the toolbar.

Corresponding test objects will be imported into folder Postman.
