Katalon TestOps Visual Testing is a feature to help us compare screenshots between executions.

On Katalon Studio, go to **Menu Project** > **Settings**. The board **Project Settings** displays, click **Katalon TestOps** on the left sidebar. We choose **Team** and **Project**, then click **Apply and Close**. And now, we integrate the current Katalon Studio project with Katalon TestOps.

Before testing a Test Suite (or Test Suite Collection) on Katalon Studio, we need to run this Test Suite (or execute Test Suite Collection). If we do not have a Test Suite, we can download the [sample code](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/visual-testing-sample) to test this feature.
