Proxy setup can be configured at: **Katalon Studio> Preferences > Katalon > Proxy**. This setting affects both WebUI and WebService testings.

In the Proxy Settings, you can select one of three options below.

* **No proxy**: there's no proxy.
* **Use system proxy configuration**: Katalon Studio tries to guess which proxy server is your system behind and sync with this setting.
* **Manual proxy configuration**: you can manually set up your proxy.

> If you're behind a Proxy Server, you'll need to configure the proxy settings before activating Katalon Studio. Click Config Proxy at the bottom of the Activation dialog box.
