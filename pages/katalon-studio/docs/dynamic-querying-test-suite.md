**Dynamic Querying Test Suite** is a built-in feature in Katalon Studio that provides query search function to various plugins and returns any matched test cases or test suites of the query statement.

This function only works when you have already installed the plugin that defines the querying syntax in Dynamic Querying Test Suite. To get these plugins, visit [Katalon Store](https://store.katalon.com/search?search=dynamic+execution); then install one of the two plugins.

After the plugin has been installed from Katalon Store, go to Katalon Studio and click **Reload Plugins**. [Learn more on how to reload plugins](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-store/docs/user/access-store-in-KS.html#reload-plugins). In case there is no installed plugin, the Query Provider will be set to default as “No query provider available.”

When you install the Dynamic Test Case Planning and Execution plugin, the option of choosing Dynamic Test Case Planning and Execution query syntax in Query Provider is enabled.
