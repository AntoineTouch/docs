[WSDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl/) is used for specifying a SOAP web service's functionality. It's critical to SOAP Web Service testing when you can create web service requests based on a WSDL file. This section shows you how to import a WSDL file into a Katalon project and help you explore a WSDL.

## Importing WSDLs into Katalon Studio

To import a WSDL file to your project, please do as follows:

1. In **Tests Explorer**, right-click on any folder of **Object Repository**
2. Select **Import > From WSDL**

3. In the **URL** field of the **Import WSDL** dialog, specify either a remote WSDL URL or a relative path of a local WSDL file (e.g:Â https://mysite/swagger.json, or [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL)).
4. Click **OK** and Katalon Studio loads the file and generates SOAP request objects.

If you've created a **API/Web Service** Project, click on the **Import WSDL** icon on the main toolbar to display the **Import WSDL** dialog in step 3.

## Working with the imported WSDLs

A WSDL may contain multiple services. For each service, Katalon Studio creates a SOAP request object with a specific Service Function and parses the specified WSDL's content into corresponding fields of an object.

For example, with [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL]([http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL]), Katalon Studio

In the **Tests Explorer**, double-click a request object to open its opened editor. When you override any fields of the imported request object with new values, you need to **save** your modifications for it to take effect.

* **WSDL URL**:
* **Service Function**:
* **Service Enpoint**: this tab stores the service endpoint parsed from the WSDL file. You can also specify another endpoint for the interface as your wish. This request object receives any value given in this field.
* **SOAPAction**:
* **Request message**:
