[WSDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl/) is used for specifying a SOAP web service's functionality. It's critical to SOAP Web Service testing when you can create web service requests based on a WSDL file. This section shows you how to import a WSDL file into a Katalon project and help you explore a WSDL.

From **version 7.5.0+**, Katalon Studio improves the WSDL importing feature with more intuitive UI and newly supported utility. Particularly, you are able to add a desired endpoint to your SOAP request, which takes precedence over the imported endpoint.

## Importing WSDLs into Katalon Studio

To import a WSDL file to your project, please do as follows:

1. In **Tests Explorer**, right-click on any folder of **Object Repository**
2. Select **Import > From WSDL**

3. In the **URL** field of the **Import WSDL** dialog, specify either a remote WSDL URL or a relative path of a local WSDL file (e.g:Â https://mysite/swagger.json, or [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL)).
4. Click **OK** and Katalon Studio loads the file and generates SOAP request objects.

If you've created a **API/Web Service** project, click on the **Import WSDL** icon on the main toolbar to display the **Import WSDL** dialog in step 3.

## Working with the imported WSDLs

A WSDL may contain multiple services. For each service, Katalon Studio creates a SOAP request with a specific Service Function and parses its content from the specified WSDL into their corresponding fields in the request object such as Service Enpoint, SOAPAction and Request message.

However, you can always manually change the content of those fields. When you override any fields of the imported request object with new values, you need to **save** your modifications for it to take effect.

* **Service Enpoint**: this tab stores the service endpoint parsed from the WSDL file. You can also specify another endpoint for the interface as your wish. This request object receives any value given in this field.
* **SOAPAction**: the SOAPAction is parsed in the HTTP Header of the request if the request method is SOAP.

For example, with [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL]([http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL]), Katalon Studio
