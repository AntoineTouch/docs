> Starting from version 6.3.0, reports can be viewed directly inside each Test Suite Collection page.

For example:

<details><summary>Deprecated Content</summary>

Once a test suite collection finishes its execution, a historical report will be automatically generated and stored in Reports. 

For example:

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-collection-report/image2017-2-24-203A483A52.png)

The report will be named with following the naming convention: _YYYYMMDD_HHmmss_, which is the datetime when the test suite collection starts its execution.
