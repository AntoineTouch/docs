## Manage and Assign Licenses

We provide different tutorials of how to grant and use different licenses:

## View Available Licenses and Machines

2. Select your **Organization > Licenses**
3. Select a Katalon product to open its view
4. The product view display the following information:

* **Subscribed Licenses**- license quota that you have purchase.
* **Available Licenses**- the remaining licenses after the subscribed license quota subtracts the total number of offline licenses created and currently active online licenses.

  > *Available licenses = Subscribed licenses quota â€“ (Offline licenses + Active online licenses)*

* **Machine Quota** is equal to the license quota.
* **Registered Users**- the users are allowed to use Katalon Studio Enterprise licenses.
* **Online Licenses**- active machines that are using online licenses.
* **Offline Licenses**- machines to which an offline license binds.
* **Registered Machines**: machines that have used either online or offline license.

## Revoke and Transfer Licenses

Only **online** licenses of Katalon Studio Enterprise and Katalon Runtime Engine are transferable among the organization's registered users as long as the active licenses do not exceed the license quota.

You can revoke a Katalon Studio Enterprise license from a user by remove the user from the **Registered Users** list. You can do the same for a registered machine.
