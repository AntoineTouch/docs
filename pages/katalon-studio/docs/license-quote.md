You need to send an email to our Sales team via business@katalon.com. They will create a quote with the details agreed by both parties and send it to you for payment. The created quote should be in the format `https://store.katalon.com/quote/review?email=<youremail>%40<yourdomain.com>&numOfKSELicenses=<numberoflicenses>`.

>Note: The email that the Katalon Sales team has created a quote for will be granted the purchased subscriptions. All payment documents will be sent to this email.

After successfully making the payment, follow these steps to start using your purchased licenses:

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com/home) with this email. If you donâ€™t have an account, register [here](https://www.katalon.com/sign-up/).

    >Note: This email is granted the Billing Manager role by default. Learn more about [User and Role management](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/user-management.html#roles-and-default-permissions) in Katalon TestOps.

2. Go to your user page > **Unassigned Subscriptions** > Assign the licenses for organizations. If you have no organizations, create one (go to Katalon TestOps home page > click **Create Organization**.)

For managing, creating, and assigning your licenses, please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-management.html).
