## Set your billing email

Katalon sends invoices and other billing-related communication to the Organization Owners/Billing Managers by default. and cc another one via email address. This will enable your team to send those emails to a person not belonging to the Organization. This is particularly helpful for an enterprise where the person in charge of billing does not need to be involved in Katalon Organization.

To add a cc email, click on **Update** button in **Payment Method** section, then fill in your email you want to cc the email with an invoice attached.
