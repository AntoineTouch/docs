## Adding and editing a payment method

You can add a payment method to your account and update your existing payment method at any time. Currently, if you subscribe to Katalon licenses via Katalon TestOps, Katalon only supports credit card payment.

To add or edit a payment method:

1. Log into [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com);
2. Select your **Organization** > **Payment Method**;
3. Click **Update** and enter another card’s details;
4. Click **Save** when you’re done.

The newly added card is automatically added to other subscriptions for future payments.

## Adding billing information to your receipts

To display additional information on your receipts:

1. Log into [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com);
2. Select your **Organization** > **Payment Method**;
3. In the **Billing Information** view, click **Update** and enter the billing information;
4. Click **Save**.

## Setting your billing email

Katalon sends invoices and other billing-related communication to the Organization Owners/Billing Managers by default. and cc another one via email address. This will enable your team to send those emails to a person not belonging to the Organization. This is particularly helpful for an enterprise where the person in charge of billing does not need to be involved in Katalon Organization.

To add a cc email, click on **Update** button in **Payment Method** section, then fill in your email you want to cc the email with an invoice attached.
