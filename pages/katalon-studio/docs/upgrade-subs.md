When you want to increase the number of subscribed licenses or switch from monthly to yearly billing cycle, you can upgrade your subscriptions at any time. The upgrading action will take effect immediately. You need to pay for the prorated amount.

Yearly billing cycle helps you save a one-month cost and allow you to use offline licenses. Please be noted that only node-locked and annual licenses can be converted to offline licenses.

To upgrade your subscription, follow these steps:

1. Log into [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com/home).
2. Select your **Organization** > **Subscriptions**.
3. Locate which product you want to upgrade, click **Upgrade** to increase the total number of licenses purchased, or switch to the annual billing cycle.

   > Please be noted that you can only upgrade a single subscription at one time.

4. Pay for the prorated amount.

   Successful payment will immediately change your subscription.
