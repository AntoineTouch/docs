    The **Start** button is enabled after the Application File text box is filled.

    Click **Start** when you're done with the settings.

4. The specified Windows application is deployed and opened on a testing machine.

5. The **Screen View** dialog box is displayed to show the current screenshot of your application on the testing machine.

    All the Windows objects in that screenshot are analyzed and organized in a tree at the **Screen Objects** section.

    Click on any object in that tree and it's highlighted in the Screen View accordingly.
