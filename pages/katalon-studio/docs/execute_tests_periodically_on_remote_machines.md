Katalon TestOps provide multiple ways to execute tests periodically on remote machines.

Katalon TestOps Agent will help you:

* Install and manage multiple versions of Katalon Runtime Engine on your test machines without any manual intervention.
* Retrieve the latest version of your Katalon Studio projects that are stored on Katalon TestOps or Git to execute, and submit the test results back to Katalon TestOps for review.
* Keep the number of concurrent executions under a configurable limit. Katalon TestOps will distribute jobs among Agents to balance their workload. This feature is especially helpful if you only have a limited number of licenses and want to queue your executions periodically.
