If you have no idea what a Katalon license is, read [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license.html). After reading that document, you still don't know which license and how many licenses to subscribe to, contact our sales team via business@katalon.com.

If you're quite clear about your demand, here's how to subscribe to Katalon licenses yourself with different methods:

1. [Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-KT.html)
2. [Katalon Store](https://www.katalon.com/pricing/)
3. [Quote](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-quote.html)

## View and Modify your subscription

In case you change your mind about the number of licenses, modify your subscription:

3. Click **Upgrade** to modify your subscription in terms of the number of licenses. Please be noted that you can only increase the total number of licenses purchased and upgrade from monthly to a yearly subscription, NOT vice versa.
