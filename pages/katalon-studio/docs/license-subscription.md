If you have no idea what a Katalon license is, read [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license.html). After reading that document, you still don't know which license and how many licenses to subscribe to, contact our sales team via business@katalon.com.

If you're quite clear about your demand, here's how to subscribe to Katalon licenses yourself with different methods:

1. [Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-KT.html)
2. [Katalon Store](https://www.katalon.com/pricing/)
3. [Quote](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-quote.html)

After successfully subscribing to a Katalon license, please make sure to deactivate and activate your Katalon account to let the Katalon license take effect.

## Subscription Renewal

Your subscription will be automatically renewed on a specific day. This information is included in the Order Confirmation email. You're not being charged if you cancel your subscription before the day.

## View and Upgrade your subscription

In case you change your mind about the number of licenses, modify your subscription:

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com/home).
2. Select your **Organization** > **Subscription**. Only the Owner and Billing Manager can access the Subscription view.
3. Click **Upgrade** to modify your subscription in terms of the number of licenses. Please be noted that you can only increase the total number of licenses purchased and upgrade from monthly to a yearly subscription, NOT vice versa.
4. Pay for your order.

> Note: License upgrade does NOT require subscription cancellation. You'll receive a refund for the remaining credit on your subscription.

## View and Cancel your subscription

1. Log in to [your account on Katalon Store](https://store.katalon.com/account).
2. Go to **My Account**, and under the **Orders** tab, you can see your subscription details.
3. Click on the order status. Here you can view order history or cancel the subscription.

> Note: Subscription cancellation does NOT issue a refund. You're still able to continue using the remaining subscription you have already purchased.
