[Katalon Analytics (Beta)](/display/KA) is a cloud-based application that provides an in-depth view of test execution reports through powerful visualization including charts, graphs, and metrics. Currently, Katalon Analytics supports integration with Katalon Studio for better test report management.

> Test Reports are only available for **Test Suite/Test Suite Collection** level.

Starting in **Katalon Studio version 7.0**, you need to specify the organization you're working on to log in to Katalon Studio. Then you can configure the integration with Katalon Analytics in two ways:

1. Right after logging in, there is a Katalon Analytics Integration pop-up window.

* Select a team in the configured organization that you have permission to access.

* Select a project under that team you’d like to work on or create your own one if you have permission.

2. In Katalon Studio, select **Project** > **Settings** > **Katalon Analytics**.
