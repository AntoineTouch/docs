**Online** licenses of KSE and KRE are transferable among the organization's registered users as long as the active licenses do not exceed the license quota.

**Offline** licenses are for using KSE and KRE without the internet. Once generated, the license cannot be revoked or transferred to a different machine. These licenses will expire in two (2) months or at the end of the subscription term, if that happens earlier.

> Any **annual** and **node-locked** licenses of KRE and KSE can be converted to offline licenses. A machine ID is required to create an offline license.

**How Katalon generates a machine ID**

Machine ID generated by Katalon is based on the hardware specifications and the user account logged into that machine at the time.

For example:

User A logs into machine A will have a machine ID X, while user B logs into machine A will have a machine ID Y. X and Y are different. Therefore, you might need 2 licenses for working in this case.
