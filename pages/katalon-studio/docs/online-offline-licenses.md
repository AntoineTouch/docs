**Online** licenses of KSE and KRE are transferable among the organization's registered users as long as the active licenses do not exceed the license quota.

**Offline** licenses are for using KSE and KRE without the internet. Once generated, the license cannot be revoked or transferred to a different machine. These licenses will expire in three (2) months or at the end of the subscription term, if that happens earlier.

> Any **annual** and **node-locked** licenses of KRE and KSE can be converted to offline licenses. A computer ID is required to create an offline license.
