Before assigning a license, the organization Owner/Admin must [add the team member(s) to the organization in the Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/user-management.html#user-related-permissions). Once added, the Admin can assign a Katalon license to any team member, or withdraw a license if no longer needed.

### Katalon Studio Enterprise

1. In [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com/home), select your **Organization > License**.

   When the registered users activate Katalon Studio Enterprise, the machine IDs are added to the **Online Licenses** list in Katalon TestOps.

   > The number of registered users cannot exceed the license quota.
