Katalon Studio currently supports API/Web Service testing project, which allows separating the API/Web Service testing from Web UI and Mobile testing. You can also perform more API/Web Service automation tasks on Katalon Studio such as _Quickstart wizard_, _Import Swagger or WSDL_ definition File/URL directly, or retrieve _request history_ at any time.

The update comes with a new interface, including a new toolbar and view that serve only for API/Web Service testing. To create the _New API/Web Service Project_, in _New Project_ dialog, simply select _API/Web Service_ type and specify all required project information.

## Toolbar

 The main toolbar contains API/Web Service testing related features only to help you navigate around the app easily and intuitively.
