These settings are applied for a test execution on a Windows desktop app. You are allowed to configure the WinAppDriver URL and Desired Capabilities for Windows to start a Windows Application Driver.

* **WinAppDriver URL**: a URL to the WinAppDriver server. By default, Katalon Studio is set to http://127.0.0.1:4723.

* **Desired Capabilities**: Katalon Studio supports the same [capabilities](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver#supported-capabilities) as WinAppDriver does.
