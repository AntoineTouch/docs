**Katalon Studio** is a smart, robust, and scalable automation solution built for both beginners and expert testers everywhere. Katalon Studio revolutionizes the use of open-source test automation frameworks such as Selenium and Appium by eliminating their technical complexities. This revolution allows developers and QAs to set up, create, run, report, and manage their automated tests for Web, Mobile, and API Testings efficiently. Starting from [Katalon Studio 7.0](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/new/version-70.html), Desktop App Testing built upon WinAppDrivers (written and maintained by Microsoft) is available for users to create automated tests for Windows Desktop Applications.
