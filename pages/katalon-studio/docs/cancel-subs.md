You can cancel your subscription at any time. This action will turn-off auto-renewal of your subscription on the next billing date.

The canceled subscription remains **active** until its next billing date. On that date, its status becomes **terminated**.

> Subscription cancelation does NOT issue a refund. You can continue using the remaining subscription you have already purchased.

Only the Organization Owner/Admins can cancel a subscription.

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com/).
2. Select your **Organization > Subscriptions**.
3. On the top right corner of the **Subscription** view, select **Edit Subscription**.
4. Click **Cancel** any active subscriptions and confirm your action.

If you cancel your subscription by mistake and would love to reactivate the canceled subscription, please contact us via license@katalon.com.
