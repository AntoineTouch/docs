> Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, you can spy and record testing an installed application on Android and iOS devices, NOT on Kobiton and remote ones.

1. Open **Mobile Object Spy**/**Mobile Recorder** with Android or iOS devices.

2. In configurations, you can start spying or recording on an existing application with an application ID. Select **Application ID**, enter the application ID in the corresponding text field, the **Start** button will be enabled.

    **Application ID** is the ID of the application file (.apk; .ipa) after being uploaded  to the cloud. The Kobitonâ€™s application ID, for instance, is **kobiton-store:23616**.

In **Mobile Recorder**

* In **Recorded Actions**, the first action is **Start Existing Application**.

* After you press **OK** button to finish its recording session, Katalon Studio will generate script with `Mobile.startExistingApplication(appId)`.
