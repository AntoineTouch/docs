### Smart XPath Generator

Most Web UI tests fail because the elements cannot be located in the application under test. Katalon Studio 5.7 offers a new object selector, **_Relative XPath_** to help increase the possibility of successfully identifying an object. The new improved Record Web Utility has also been equipped with better record engine. This makes Katalon Studio more responsive to users' actions, ensuring every key action is captured.

### Improve Katalon Analytics Integration

**Test Execution History** can be viewed directly at a specific Test Case or Test Suite View. The project team can quickly know the performance of the test and identify the trouble areas to optimize overall test executions. You can also access a specific test report on Katalon Analytics directly from Katalon Studio, reducing the time it takes to identify an execution on Katalon Analytics.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/new/version-560/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-11.52.48-AM.png)

### Improve Web Record/Spy Utility

* **Web Record/Spy** Utility is improved to support **Firefox Active Mode**. Now you can record right on the opened Firefox browser without wasting system resource to open a new browser instance.
* **Improve execution mechanism when 'element can't be found' error**: Katalon Studio will try to use other element's properties using heuristic method to locate the element and log the result for you. Test execution still returns FAILURE, since it is not guaranteed to be correct and the decision should be made by users.
* **Better** objects recognition for **dropdown** using **Record Web** Utility.

### Fixes and Improvements

* **Add Sample Project option within 'Create New Project' dialogue:** 'Create new project' pop-up now have the options to create a new sample project to help save time and cut down repetitive steps.
* **Reduce Katalon Studio** package size by 10%.

## Version 5.5

### Improved Web Recorder

The new Web Recorder will have a similar interface to Test Case View. With the new Recorder, you can:

* Continue recording existing test cases to minimize the hassle of re-recording long and complex tests.
* Edit test cases during recording so that the recording process can be optimized.
* Run test steps in the Recorder interface, making sure the recorded steps are executable.
* Merge and override test objects after recording, optimizing the object repositories.

## Version 5.3.0

### General

In version 5.3, Katalon team enhanced generated **XPath** for Test Objects. With the new robust XPath, test objects can be better located in the AUT. Thus, test quality is improved significantly.

**Auto-saved** last **execution environment** is implemented in Version 5.3 to help save the last selected execution environment as default. Katalon Studio will replace the current default execution environment with the selected one (if it's different).
For Katalon to be Docker-ready

* Add extra argument for Chrome in **Console Mode** execution: `--no-sandbox`
* Remove splash screen in CLI mode
* Separate command for generate/update classpath
* Fix bugs when using CLI mode with properties file

### Test Suite

Implement [**Setup** / **Teardown**](/x/E4C9) for Test Suite. This feature is another great extension besides [Test Listener](/katalon-studio/docs/test-listeners-test-hooks.html) to extend your current testing flow as much as possible.
