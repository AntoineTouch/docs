# Katalium

Katalium is a framework that provides a blueprint for test automation projects based on TestNG and Selenium.

When it comes to Selenium-based testing, Katalon Studio is the software of choice for testers and automation engineers to date. It offers a host of built-in features that simplify building test cases for users. However, for users who still need to work with TestNG and Selenium, Katalium Framework is a great head start.

Tailored to be a lightweight and accessible platform for all users, Katalium retains the standard functions of TestNG and Selenium. By leveraging the common open-source frameworks functionalities, the learning curve and transition efforts are minimized, allowing users to execute their projects better and faster.
