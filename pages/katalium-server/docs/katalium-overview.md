Katalium Server is a set of enhancements to improve your experience with Selenium Grid. It aims at eliminating DevOps efforts required to configure, deploy, and maintain a Selenium Grid. Monitoring and debugging are made easy with real-time screenshots and information captured automatically.

Katalium Server can also run as a Standalone (single) server in development mode.
