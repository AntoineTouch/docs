You can either create release directly in Katalon TestOps or populate existing releases from Jira using the **Create Release**, or **Populate Jira Releases** button respectively.

In Katalon TestOps, click **Populate Jira Releases** to get all the existing releases from Jira, then link your test run with the populated release. The test run results that you already linked will be shown under the **Release** section in Jira.

Alternatively, in Katalon TestOps, click **Create Release**, select a Jira Project and Jira Release to associate the Katalon’s release with existing Jira’s one, then link your test run with the newly created release so that you can also view the test run results in Jira **Release** section.
