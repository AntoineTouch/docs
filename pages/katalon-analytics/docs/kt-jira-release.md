## Populate a Jira Release

You can either create Release directly in **Katalon TestOps** or populate existing releases from Jira using the "*Create Release*", or "*Populate Jira Releases*" button respectively.

To populate a Jira Release, go to Test Planning and select *Releases* tab > click "*Populate Jira Releases*" to get all the existing Releases from Jira, then follow the above section to link your Test Run with the populated release. The test run results that you already linked will be shown under the **Release** section in Jira.

## Link Test Runs to a Release

You can link Test Runs to a Release that you have created.

In your project, go to **Reports & Analytics** and select *Test Runs* > Select a Test Run ID that you want to link to a Release > Click on "*Link to a Release*" and select a release from the drop-down list.

## View Release Readiness by Test Case status

You can view what Test Cases passed or failed in their most recent Test Runs by going to Release details page.

A Test Case is shown as passed if and only if all of its Test Runs pass in its most recent execution. A Test Case can run multiple times in an execution (for example, with multiple data rows).

To view details, click on the *Passed/Failed* labels.

> If you have linked a TestOps Release to a Jira Release, you can also view Test Case status directly in Jira.
