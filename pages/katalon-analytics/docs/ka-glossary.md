**Agent**  

With Katalon Analytics's agent tool, you can execute your test plan yourself on an in-house server infrastructure.

**Dashboard**  

Dashboard displays test executions from one or more projects under a team, giving users an easy way of viewing and navigating to each execution to learn about its details. There are two types of dashboards in Katalon Analytics:

* Team Dashboard: For team owners and admins to view and manage their test results imported to KA.
* Project Dashboard: For teams to have an overview of test cases with passed and failed results.

**Organization**  

Organizations are shared Katalon Analytics accounts where groups of users can collaborate across several projects at once. A user defaults to owning a personal organization and can belong to many organizations.

**Project**  

A Katalon Anlytics project is a handful of reports generated based on a dataset of automation test results which are imported by users. It would typically represent the development of automation testing work. A project is created only by Admins of a team with a particular name and automatically generated ID. There are many projects in a team.

**Release**   

A release can be considered a milestone of your product. This feature is to enhance the  integration with your release in Jira.

**Role**  

Katalon Analytics (beta) provides a set of default roles that have certain permissions related to user and project management. There are three roles including Owner, Admin, and User with hierarchical capabilities.

**Status**  

Test status is a test result of a test run or a test execution. There are four statuses including Passed, Failed, Error and Incomplete. 

**Task**  

 A task is a unit of work linked to relevant test results, which allows users to track certain issues related to test performance.

**Team**  

Teams are groups of users that reflect the company's structures. A team is created by either Owner or Admin in an organization. Only members of a team can view and access the projects within that team.

**User**   

A user is a personal Katalon Analytics account. Each user has a personal organization and can work on multiple projects. They can be invited to join other users' organizations and teams.

> Note: Organizational and team levels are separate. An organization owner, for instance, can be a team user.
