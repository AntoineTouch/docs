TestOps allows you to compare the results of multiple test executions in a side-by-side table so that you can easily know whether or not a test is producing the same result each time it is run.

1. Go to **Executions** section in your project;
2. Select test executions from the Executions list by checking the checkboxes;
3. Click on the **Compare** button;

> Note: You can select up to 3 test executions to view the comparison.

Now you can view the execution details and comparison charts.
