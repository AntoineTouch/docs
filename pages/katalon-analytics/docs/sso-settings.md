## Invite and enable SSO for Organization members

After you have configured SSO for your Organization, you can invite and enable SSO for each member.

### Invite and enable SSO for a new user

Learn how to invite users to an organization [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-org-team-project.html#invite-a-user-to-the-organization).

In the **Login Options** section in the **Invite users** page, enable the SSO option and click on **Invite** to finish.

A request to enable SSO will be sent to invited users. 

This action will be *pending* until your member [accepts the request](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-org-team-project.html#invite-a-user-to-the-organization).

> Note: The *â€œVerify Single Sign-On authentication"* email will be sent to invited users once they have accepted the invitation to join the organization.

### Enable SSO for an existing member

To enable SSO for an existing member in an organization, in **Katalon Admin** page, go to **Users** and select an account you want to enable SSO. Click on the pencil icon to go to the details page.

In the **Login Options** section in the user's details page, enable the SSO option.

## View and Manage User Authentication
