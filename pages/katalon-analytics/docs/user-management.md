In Katalon TestOps, each user is identified with the same account registered for Katalon Studio. Users will have a role and associated permission to work on TestOps. A User may have different roles and permission at the organization level and team level.

## **Organization level** 

* **Owner** - is the Owner of their organizations by default, who has full permission related to the organization, including teams, users, projects, licenses, plugins, and subscriptions.
* **Admin** - is granted by the Owner, who has the privileges of the Owner but cannot manage the subscriptions.
* **Billing Manager** - is granted by the Owner or Admin, who has the privileges of the Owner but cannot manage the users.
* **User** - is automatically assigned when a person is first invited to collaborate in an organization. Users can create new organizations, manage teams, and projects.

## **Team level**

* **Owner** - is the Owner of the team created by themselves, who has full permission, including users and projects of their team.
* **Admin** - is granted by the Owner, who has the privileges of the Owner but cannot transfer the team ownership to an existing team member.
