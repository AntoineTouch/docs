After downloading and configuring Agents, the next step is to create a test project in **Code Repo**. It is where you store your test projects for remote execution.

On Katalon TestOps, go to your **Project**, choose **TestOps CI** and select **Code Repo**. Here you can view your existing projects or create a new test project.

To create a new test project:

1. Click **Create Test Project** on the top right corner.
2. Give a name to your project and describe what it does.
3. Click **Choose Files** to browse to your compressed project code from your local machine. If you store your project in a code repository such as Github, you can download the project zip package from Github.
4. Click **Create** to upload the project code.

When it is completely uploaded, you can click **Plan** to schedule an execution for it. Learn more about [scheduling tests on Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-scheduler.html).
