Script Repository is used to store your automation test scripts in **Katalon TestOps** that allows you to better manage and organize your test projects for Remote Execution.

Your test scripts can be uploaded as a .zip file or from Git repositories.

## Upload a .zip file to a Script Repository

In **Configurations**, select *"Script Repositories"* > Click on *"Create Script Repository"*. 

1. Give a name to your project and describe what it does.
2. Click *Choose Files* to browse to your compressed project code from your local machine. *Note: only a .zip file is allowed.*
3. Click *Create* to upload the project code.

Once your test scripts have been uploaded, you can view them from the list of Script Repositories.
