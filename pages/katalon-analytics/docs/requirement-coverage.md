In **Reports & Analytics**, go to *"Requirements"* section > select *"Test Run Coverage"*. Here you can view a heat map chart showing the quality of each Requirement based on the status of the corresponding Test Result.

- Size of each block indicates the number of Test Runs associated with each Requirement.
- Color of each block indicates the overall status of the total Test Cases in each Requirement.
