Katalon Analytics allows you to link task to your test case so that you can easily manage and keep track with your task list.

## Create and view tasks

To create new task, go to **Tasks** section and click on **Create Task** button. Input information and save.

A new task will be created in the list with **Task ID**.

## Add task ID for test case

In your test case in Katalon Analytics, add **Task ID** under **Task** field. The test case will be added to a corresponding task.


## Sort and filter test case in Task

You can filter and sort any test cases to view the execution information that matters in **Task**. Any issues or trouble areas can be quickly drilled-down to with provided quality insights.
