Continue the following steps:
* Send a request to Recurly to create a new subscription immediately
* Send a request to Stripe to create a new invoice.


If payment fails, it could be the following reasons:
* Invalid card. "Invalid card number‚Äù error displays and restricts checking out
* Other reasons. Errors from Stripe display and restrict checking out

If the card validation process has passed but the system fails in charging the card, start [dunning process](https://docs.recurly.com/docs/dunning-management).
* If successful, continue the subscription
* If failed, terminate the subscription
