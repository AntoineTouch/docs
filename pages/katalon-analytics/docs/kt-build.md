A **Test Case** is shown as passed only if all of its **Test Runs** are marked as passed in its most recent execution. A **Test Case** can run multiple times in an execution (for example, with multiple data rows).

To view details, click on the *Passed/Failed* labels.

> If you have linked a TestOps Release to a Jira Release, you can also view Test Case status directly in Jira.
