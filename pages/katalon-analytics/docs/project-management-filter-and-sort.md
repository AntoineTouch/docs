## Filter

Filtering is a handy tool for users to see only their preferred data to be displayed in different types of data presentation in Katalon Analytics. By applying a filter, you can customize the demonstration of certain records in a graph or a table.

**How to apply a filter**

1. Click on the filter icon on the top right corner of each graph or table.
2. Click **Add Filter** to choose the field in the drop-down list, then select the filter that you want. All the filters excluding “**is empty**", “**is not empty**" prompt you to enter the necessary values.

3. Click **Add condition** to apply.

**Notes:**
* More than one filter can be applied.
* In a graph, click on a value to directly remove it from the visual presentation while another click is to bring it back (to remove the filter).

**Remove a filter**

To switch to the view of unfiltered data, remove the filters by clicking icon X on each filter text box.

## Sort

Currently, Katalon Analytics only supports arranging data by text (A to Z or Z to A), and numbers (smallest to largest or largest to smallest) in one or multiple columns.

**How to do a sort**

1. Click on the filter icon on the top right corner of each graph or table.
2. Click on the sort text box, and then select an item from the drop-down list of several fields with its predefined order (Ascending and Descending).

**Remove a sort**

You can remove a sort by clicking on icon X on each sort text.
