## Prerequisites

- You have scheduled your Test Runs. [Learn more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/create-plan.html)

## Execute Test Runs

After we scheduled Test Runs in Katalon TestOps, we can execute them without Katalon Studio. Before running a Test Run, we have to run the Agent of that Test Run. For running the Agent, we can [see here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/install_kt_agent.html). In **Test Planning**, choose **Test Run Types**, click on the Run button.

After you have finished executing the Test Runs, you can view the status in the calendar view. [Learn more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/create-plan.html#view-test-runs)
