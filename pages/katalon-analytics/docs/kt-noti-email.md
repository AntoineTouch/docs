Executing scheduled jobs and uploading test results may take a while. For watching scheduled jobs and uploaded test results better, you can customize the events on which you want to receive notification emails from Katalon.

On **Katalon TestOps**, go to your account and select **Notifications**, specify your settings and click **Save**.
