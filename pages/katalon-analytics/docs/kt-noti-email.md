Executing scheduled jobs and uploading test results may take a while. For watching scheduled jobs and uploaded test results better, you can customize the events on which you want to receive notification emails from Katalon.

## Update Notification Email Settings

Once you have enabled TestOps integration in Katalon Studio, these settings are turned on by default. You will receive notification emails of:

* Failed test results uploaded in Katalon TestOps
* Weekly reports of your testing activities

You can turn on/off these settings in Katalon TestOps by going to **Profile** menu in the right top corner.
