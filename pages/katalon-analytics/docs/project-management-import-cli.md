Katalon Analytics supports various types of test automation report generated by Katalon Studio and Katalon Recorder, and in JUnit formats.

1. Download [Reports Uploader](https://github.com/katalon-studio/report-uploader/releases) and install [Java JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. Get the path to your Katalon Report folders, e.g. `C:\Users\alex\Katalon Studio\Web Sample\Reports\Test Suite\20190523_143946`.

3. Start Command Prompt and use the following command to upload Katalon Report:

```
java -jar katalon-report-uploader-0.0.5.jar --projectId=3 --path="d:\katalon-reports" --email=admin@mail.me --password=admin --type=katalon
```
* `projectId`: Your project ID in Katalon TestOps.
* `path`: The local path of Katalon Studio Reports folder identified in step 2.
* `email`: The email registered for your Katalon account. If an API Key is used as `password`, this field is not required.
* `password`: The password used for signing in Katalon TestOps or an API Key of that account. Using API Key is recommended as it will not expose your password.
* `type`: One of the values "katalon", "junit", or "katalon_recorder".
* `server`: (**Optional**) The Katalon TestOps server endpoint, by default it is `https://analytics.katalon.com`.
