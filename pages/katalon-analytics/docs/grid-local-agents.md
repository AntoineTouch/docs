**Grid and Agents** are designed to make Katalon Studio test execution simpler and schedulable on your local servers. You now can run your planned tests at any time with just a click. You can also speed up the test execution by distributing them across browsers and operating systems, and running them in parallel or on schedule.

To execute a scheduled test plan, in your project, select **Grid** > locate the plan you want to execute > click this button <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/remote-execution/button.png" width="20" height=""> to execute the plan.

Depending on the number of selected Agents, new jobs will be initiated and queued on the Jobs list right on top of the screen. If they are executed successfully, you will see a link that leads you to the execution result.
