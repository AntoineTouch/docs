Remote Execution is available on both Katalon TestOps and Katalon TestOps OnPremise. You can maximize the capacity of local servers available and speed up the testing process by executing automation tests remotely. Also, the test execution results are automatically fed to Katalon TestOps for generating reports and analytics.

**Prerequisites**:

* You have unzipped your Katalon Studio project that contains Test Suites and/or Test Suite Collections.
* You need to have a project on Katalon TestOps.
* You need an active [Katalon Runtime Engine license](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/intro-RE.html#license) for executing Katalon Studio in console mode.

Follow these steps to execute your tests on Katalon TestOps:

* Download and configure [Agents](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/agents.html).
* Upload Test Projects to [Code Repo](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/code-repo.html).
* [Schedule](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-scheduler.html) a test with Grid.
* [Execute the scheduled test](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/grid-local-agents.html)
* View [Test Results](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/project-management-view-reports.html) and [Reports](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/project-management-view-details.html).
