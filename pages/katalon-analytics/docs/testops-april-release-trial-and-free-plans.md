## TestOps Trial and Free Plans

### Trial Plan 
Valid email registration is eligible for a 3-month trial of Katalon TestOps Enterprise (KTE). 

When your trial period expires, you need to subscribe to the monthly or annual subscription to continue using the full features of KTE. Otherwise, your plan will be reverted to the TestOps Free version.

If you are a Katalon Studio user, you are automatically entitled to TestOps Free. You can submit a Trial Request for a 3-month trial of KTE.
 > You can only register for KTE using business emails.

### Activate Katalon TestOps Enterprise for new users
If you are not Katalon Studio users, you can submit a trial request via TestOps in one of the following ways:
1. From TestOps Subscription page

### Access grant for KTE Cloud
Once submitting the Trial Request using your business email, the request is auto-approved. You could use the trial KTE for three months. The trial period will be displayed on the TestOps Subscription page.
